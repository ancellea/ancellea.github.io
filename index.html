            <h2>Problem Statement: expired food</h2>
            <p> 
                Our users often lose track of the food they own. Between preferences, diets, and recipes they also have to manage expiration dates and amounts. All of this often leads to wasting food by letting it expire which wastes money. Not to mention accidently eating expired food can make the user extremely sick. Our solution should make tracking the food in their kitchen easy and remind them before their food expires.
