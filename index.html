                Our users often lose track of the food they own.
                 Between preferences, diets, and recipes they also have to manage expiration dates and Quantities.
                  All of this often leads to wasting food by letting it expire, and accidently eating expired food can make the user
                   extremely sick. Our solution should make tracking the
                    food in their kitchen easy and remind them before their food expires.
